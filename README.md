# TaiChiProject
This is an ongoing project based on Unreal Engine 4.18.3.

Our goal is to build a Tai Chi learning system using HTV vive and motion capture devices.

When finished, the system should feature these functions:
* Some pre-captured animations from which users will learn Tai Chi.
* Able to record user's motion and replay it.
* Able to give a reasonable score to evaluate the similarity between the pre-captured motion and the user's.
* etc.
